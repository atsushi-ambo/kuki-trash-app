# Refactoring Summary

## Directory Structure Refactoring Completed

### What was done:

1. **Created organized directory structure:**
   - `src/web/` - Web application code (JS, CSS, assets)
   - `src/shared/` - Shared data files (garbageData.js, regionData.js)
   - `tests/web/` - Web application tests
   - `tests/alexa/` - Alexa skill tests
   - `tools/` - Development utilities
   - `alexa-skill/docs/` - Alexa documentation
   - `alexa-skill/models/` - Interaction models

2. **Moved files to appropriate locations:**
   - Main app files → `src/web/js/`
   - Stylesheets → `src/web/css/`
   - Icons and assets → `src/web/assets/icons/`
   - Data files → `src/shared/`
   - Test files → `tests/web/` and `tests/alexa/`
   - Tools → `tools/`
   - Alexa docs → `alexa-skill/docs/`
   - Interaction models → `alexa-skill/models/`

3. **Updated file references:**
   - `index.html` - Updated CSS, JS, and icon paths
   - `manifest.json` - Updated icon paths
   - `sw.js` - Updated cache paths
   - `app.js` - Updated service worker registration
   - `package.json` - Updated script paths
   - `Dockerfile` - Updated COPY commands

4. **Maintained functionality:**
   - All existing features work correctly
   - Web app loads and functions properly
   - Service worker caches updated paths
   - Development server works with new structure

### Benefits:

1. **Better Organization:** Related files are grouped logically
2. **Easier Maintenance:** Clear separation of concerns
3. **Improved Scalability:** Structure supports future growth
4. **Developer Experience:** Easier to find and modify files
5. **Clean Separation:** Web, Alexa, tests, and tools are clearly separated

### Testing:

- ✅ Web application loads correctly
- ✅ Service worker paths updated
- ✅ Development server works
- ✅ Docker configuration updated
- ✅ Package scripts updated

The directory is now well-organized, maintainable, and ready for continued development!
